        The web platform currently lacks a means to prevent a device from
        entering a power-saving state (i.e., some means that prevents an aspect
        of the system from "going to sleep"). As this document tries to
        demonstrate, there are strong use cases where applications need to
        temporarily prevent some aspect of the device from entering a
        power-saving state. As this functionality is common on other platforms,
        this document tries to make the case that this functionality should
        also be made available to the web platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand the use cases that motivate an application from
        preventing a device from entering a power-saving state we examined a
        set of applications running on iOS, Android, and FireFox OS. By looking
        at these native applications, and the conditions under which they
        prevent a device from entering a power-saving state, we've come up with
        a set of <a>requirements</a>. We hope that the web community can
        address these requirements by creating a specification that affords
        similar functionality to the web platform.

      <h2>
        Why we need wake locks on the Web
      </h2>
      <p>
        For tasks such as watching a video full-screen user agents have, for a
        long time now, prevented the screen from going to sleep automatically.
        Naturally users would be annoyed if they were watching a movie and
        constantly needed to move a mouse or poke at the screen of a device to
        stop the screen from going black (something that was not uncommon a few
        years back - and something not too uncommon still when people are
        presenting from Web browsers during conferences, for instance).

      <h3>
        Keeping a screen 'awake'
      </h3>
      <p>
        As computing devices have become increasingly mobile, users find
        themselves relying on mobile devices to assist them with everyday tasks
        where it is not always practical or desirable to touch the device to
        keep it "awake". These can be simple things, like using the phone as a
        flashlight, to complex tasks such as cooking or allowing the phone to
        navigate us to some destination while driving. In addition, touch
        enabled devices have become commodified enough that they can be used as
        interactive signage. Some of these use cases are illustrated in the
        figure below.
      </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>
          Examples of tasks and contexts in which it is nessesary to prevent
          the screen from going to sleep: from right to left, navigation from
          one location to another, reading and e-book, preparing a meal by
          following a recipe, and using a touch-enabled device as signage. In
          this final case, the device displays if a particular meeting room is
          booked - and allows users to manage booking a room by interacting
          with the screen, which is always on.

      <h3>
        Keeping a running task from stopping when the screen goes 'to sleep'
      </h3>
      <p>
        On the flip-side, keeping the screen on is not the only kind of "wake
        lock" applications require. It is well-known that, under normal
        conditions, the display of a device consumes a high percentage of a
        device's battery. Only keeping the screen on when absolutely necessary
        can greatly assist in prolonging the battery life of a device
        throughout a day.
      </p>
      <p>
        As mobile devices are generally not as powerful as desktop class
        machines, and because of the uncertain network conditions under which
        these devices operate, some tasks can take a long time to complete -
        longer than users are willing to wait before putting their device back
        into their pocket, or sometimes longer than the default timeout most
        devices have to put the screen to sleep (e.g., 1 minute or there
        abouts). Consider importing and processing a set of contacts over a
        slow network connection, which can sometimes take minutes. It would be
        unrealistic to expect the user to hold their phone in their hand while
        they wait for a synchronization task to complete: users should be able
        to switch off the screen of a device and trust that an application will
        do its best to complete a certain task in the background.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words the user shutting off the screen doesn't mean that an
        application must stop running and have the device enter a low-power state.
        An application may need to intervene and finish what it's doing or it
        risks data-loss. In another concrete example a user may compose an email
        with a large photo attachment. When they press send they just as
        quickly press the power button to turn off the screen and put the phone
        back in their pocket. In such a situation, as happens with iOS's mail
        app, the application continues to run by sending the email before
        putting the phone in a low-power state. Note that this system level
        lock includes keeping the WiFi and cellular radio from also shutting
        down or entering a low power state while some task is being performed.

        Methodology and limitations
      </h2>
      <p>
        We used <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_sampling">convenience
        sampling</a> to select the applications in this document. That is, we
        selected applications that we knew prevented the screen from going to
        sleep when the application was being used to perform some particular
        action. We also reached out to people on twitter for suggestions as to
        which applications we should look at. Suggestions were captured as
        "<a href=
        "https://github.com/w3c-webmob/screen-wake-use-cases/issues">issues</a>"
        in our GitHub repository.
      </p>As stated on Wikipedia's entry about <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_sampling">convenience
      sampling</a>: "[one] cannot scientifically make generalizations about the
      total population from this sample because it would not be representative
      enough." Regardless, we view the range of applications we collected as
      exemplifying common use cases for this kind of functionality. As such, we
      still created requirements from what we observed across applications and
      platforms. We encourage the community to contribute more, or
      contradictory/abuse-cases, examples to the Web and Mobile IG. You can do this
      via a pull request to the <a href=

          How we looked at the apps

        <p>
          For each application, we asked:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Why does the application stop the screen from going to sleep for longer than the device default setting?
          </li>
          <li>What benefits does the user or application get by allowing the screen to stay awake? (e.g., the user can read an e-book uninterrupted or the application can be controlled via voice input)
          </li>
          <li>When is the wake lock applied and released?

      <h2>
        Support on native platforms
      </h2>
      <p>
        Below is a list of APIs from native platforms that developers can make
        use of to prevent a device from going to sleep. The list shows that
        this functionality is common available to developers without
        significant security restrictions. It is important to note that some
        platforms differentiate between putting the system to sleep and putting
        the display to sleep. Requesting that the system (or "CPU") not sleep,
        which allowing the display to sleep, allows long running tasks to
        complete before the device puts itself to sleep.

          The application allows users to follow football matches in real-time:

          During a match, the user can simply place their device on a surface

          hand. Without requiring any user interaction, light-weight textual
          and graphical information is streamed to the device and automatically
          displayed on screen . This means that the user does not need to
          interact directly with the device to receive updates of what is
          happening during a match. Note that this application does not stream
          live video.

        display. The display being the screen or primary output modality of the
        device. The system meaning that the device can put the screen to sleep,
        but MUST continue running a task until an application releases the lock
        on the system. Keeping the screen awake MUST also keep the system
        awake.
        </li>
        <li>MUST allow developers to release a previously requested wake lock.
        </li>
        <li>SHOULD allow scripts to check if an application already holds a
        particular kind of lock.
        </li>
        <li>MUST make the user agent ultimately responsible for managing the
        wake locks. The user agent MAY automatically release the lock for
        security reasons, and MUST release all locks when an application is
        closed. It MAY also release the lock after some amount of inactivity.
        </li>
        <li>MUST NOT be applied solely at the application level (e.g., just
        once when the application starts). Instead, developers MUST be able to
        request wake locks at arbitrary moments in time to help the user
        complete a task.
        </li>
        <li> MUST be possible for the end user to override the  wake lock on the screen (e.g.,
        by pressing the power button on the device, which puts the screen to
        sleep). Applications MUST be notified when such a thing happens, so
        they can request a system lock if they need to complete some task.
